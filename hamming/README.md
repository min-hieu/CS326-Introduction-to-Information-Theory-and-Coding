# Hamming Code

We want to implement the (7,4,3) Hamming code with the parity check matrix `H` over a binary symmetric channel with probability `p`. The transmitted codeword, received vector and estimated codeword is denoted `c`,`r`, and `c_hat` respectively. The output of the program should show the graph of the theoretical derivation and emperical result of the probabilities of error that occur.
